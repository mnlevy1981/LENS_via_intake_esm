## Accessing LENS Data on `/glade` with `intake-esm`

This repo gives a brief example of how to use `intake-esm` to read a catalog pointing to LENS data.
The catalog was created based on the `yaml` file in `collection_gen/`.
That directory also contains an older version of the `yaml` file and instructions on generating the intake `netCDF` file / converting it to `json` and `csv`.
